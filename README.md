# ESP_E53-DRONE 
The idea of this project is to use a really cheap drone as **plattform for experiements with GPS, compass, optical flow, and other sensors and finally to build an autonomous drone**. To achive that, first I had to find a way for simply adding new sensors and control software, if possible without reengineering the the whole onboard-software. The approach is, to add an additional ESP8266 controller onboard and let it interface with the drone's native controller via WiFi. Also add some upgrades from Autel Robotics EVO II Dual 640T V3 .  I am not turning E58 Into EVO ,I am just doing it better drone from normal E58 drones
